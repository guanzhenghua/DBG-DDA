Code for paper: DBG-DDA: a dual-branch graph learning method for drug-disease associations prediction.

This repository provides a clean, research‑ready implementation of DBG‑DDA, a dual‑branch graph representation learning framework for drug–disease association (DDA) prediction. The pipeline first learns low‑level structural features through a Graph‑Attention‑Transformer (GATT) module and high‑level semantic features through a meta‑path aggregation module (TAHIN), then fuses them and uses an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier for final prediction.
